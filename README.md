PhotoRing is a tool that allows someone visualize and traverse a big repository of images across *all its dimensions* without losing context. 

Let’s define some of the terms in that definition:

Image: This image has tags and natural dimensions associated with it:

### Natural dimensions: 

Author, Date taken, camera, location, picture properties such as opacity, brightness, etc. This natural dimensions usually apply to most if not all images in the dataset. By "apply" I mean an image has a value associated to that dimension.

### Tags: 

Tags are associated keywords with each image. 

### Context:

 Set of variables that completely describe the current position and interaction of the user with the dataset. The exact variables that made up context are not defined yet. 

### Visualize: 

Once the user is positioned in a certain place of the dataset (which has a context associated with it), he can see the images at multiple focus levels: 1 picture, 10, 100 pictures. This feature is similar to zoom it/out the photos library on iOS. How much can a user zoom out?

### Traverse: 

The user is able to move continuously across the dataset. Also, he can jump between “places”, keeping context between the jumps. This means, a user can go back to the previous place he was in. Can he go back further than that?
